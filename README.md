# kuout

Whats this?
  It is an inspiration sharing app where people can write, read and share quotes.

How does it work?
  You can be 'reading'(following) users or be 'read'(followed) by users.
  Each user can write up to 10 kuouts per day.
  Posts are deleted automatically after 24 hours.
  There are options on what font and background will be used for each post.
  People can vote on kuouts.
  The kuouts with more votes will appear on a top of the day, top of the week, top of the month.
  Each month the kuout with more votes will become the 'kuout of the month' and will be showed
  with the user name of its writer next to it somewhere special.
